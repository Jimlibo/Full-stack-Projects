This repository contains some more serious projects. Some of them were done as an excercise for university, while others
were made for my own personal development.

The NTUA_DB_General project, is a simplified no-face-control system for a hotel. Clients are given a NFC bracelet with a
unique id, that allowes them to have access to specific rooms and services. By recording where and when the clients were, 
we have access to statistical data. The most important feature of the software, is that given the fact that a client was 
diagnosed positive to Covid-19, we are able to find other possible victims that were in the same space with him at almost 
the same time. For the database, MySQL was used, while the frontend was made with HTML and CSS. Finally, the backend is 
based on PHP.
